# Godot-WFC-Csharp
This is a wave function collapse inplementation for godot in C#.

Please refer to garden.tscn as an example on how to use. basically you need 2 tile maps one to create a new map on (target) and one to use as a sample on how the tiles are used (sample).

Some features are still a work in progress. (especially some optimization needs to be done as the code is currently too slow)
